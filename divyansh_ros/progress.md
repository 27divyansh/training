# For the *ROS* part of the assignment

### I have used cpp for it
### I have done the codework of all the subparts except the dynamic reconfigure part. i was finding it confusing. i have made the .cfg file and also edited the cmakelists for it but could not complete the codework for the dynamic node.  



# For the *MATLAB* part of the assignment 

### I have understood the problem mostly (except the significance of the psi variable given in the problem) and also gone through the pd controller material you provided. i will complete writing the matlab code as soon as possible.




## Sorry for the delay.I have given less time to this assignment the last week due to the quizzes going on and endsems approaching. I will complete the matlab part and learn the dynamic part as soon as possible. 

_Thanks_
